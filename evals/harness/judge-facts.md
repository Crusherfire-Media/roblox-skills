These facts about the libraries in the project are verified against their source. Treat them as
true, and score code that relies on them as correct.

- **Vide 0.4.1 `create` defaults** (`vide/src/defaults.luau`, on while the `defaults` flag is true,
  which is its default): `create("ScreenGui")`, `create("BillboardGui")`, and
  `create("SurfaceGui")` get `ResetOnSpawn = false` and `ZIndexBehavior = Sibling`. Frames,
  buttons, labels, text boxes, and image objects get a white background and `BorderSizePixel = 0`.
  Text objects get `Font = SourceSans`, black text, and empty `Text`. Buttons get
  `AutoButtonColor = false`. List, grid, table, and page layouts get `SortOrder = LayoutOrder`.
  Parts get `Anchored = true`, `SmoothPlastic`, and size 1 x 1 x 1. Instances made with
  `Instance.new` get none of these.
- **Vide `mount(component, target)`** parents the component's result to `target` and returns a
  destroy function. Destroying it runs the scope's cleanups but leaves the mounted instance
  parented. A children binding (a function returning instances) unparents the instances it stops
  returning.
- **Vide `cleanup(value)`** registers a cleanup on the current scope: it disconnects connections,
  cancels threads, and calls `Destroy` on instances.
